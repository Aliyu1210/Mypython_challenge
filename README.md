#                                                   Background
**In this assignment, I use the concepts I've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where I newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.**
## Steps 
### Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:
Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 

 Clone the new repository to your computer.

 Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, I developed a python script that analyze the financial records of a company. I used a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

#### Here are the analyzes I carried out from the dataset:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis aligned with the following results:

#### Financial Analysis
##### ----------------------------
##### Total Months: 86
##### Total: $22564198
##### Average Change: $-8311.11
##### Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
##### Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
In addition, my final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Instructions

During this challenge, I contributed to the analysis aimed at modernizing the voting process in a small rural town.

I used a poll dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset comprises three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." My task is to create a Python script to analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

My analysis aligned with the following results:

#### Election Results
##### -------------------------
##### Total Votes: 369711
##### -------------------------
##### Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
##### Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
##### Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
##### -------------------------
##### Winner: Diana DeGette
##### -------------------------
In addition, My final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
